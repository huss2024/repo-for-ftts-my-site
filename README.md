in this files i have included all my original files of my site, to try to make my site work for giving free text to speech conversion; with features different language, pitch, gender, download, etc. 
the codes i am going to include are from mozilla text to speech (opensource) service that is free
am going to upload these files for PaLM (google AI) to evaluate for me and make all the files and codes create integrationa and compatibility for the intended site functionality.
